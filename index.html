        <p>I grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado where I learned to love the
          outdoors and running. I started running in high school and walked on to the
          cross-country team at the University of Northern Colorado. After a few
          stress fractures, I gave up cross-country to join the Athletic Training
          program. Athletic Training has provided many opportunities to travel
          and explore the world around me. From Indiana to China to Guatemala to
          Ohio, the adventures continue. After moving to Ohio, I met my fiance,
          Parker. With the wedding coming, the adventures continue. My free time
          includes running, knitting, cooking, and learning to program. I love
          running marathons and half-marathons. Occasionally, I will run other
          distances. I have a secret love of Jelly Beans and almost anything
          sweet. On the weekend, you can find Parker and I in our favorite local
          coffee shop.

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Summer in February</h3>
      <h5 class="date">February 24, 2017</h5>
      <p> The weather in Ohio has been so warm this week. I ran in shorts and a
        t-shirt this morning and was so sweaty when I got home. We are so blessed
         by this gorgeous weather. I am really hoping it sticks around for next weekend,
         but alas, its probably not guarenteed. It is always so much easier to go
         out and run when it is beautiful out. I was really struggling in January
         when the windchill was in the single digits. I would get up in the morning
         and think, "I need to get out and run, but my bed is so much warmer." So,
         I am really thankful for the unseasonably warm temperatures.
         <br><br>
         I cannot wait for all the festivities next week. Most of the wedding stuff
         is done and we are ready for next week to arrive. My parents come Wednesday
         and then everyone else should arrive shortly after that. I have my final
         dress fitting this Sunday and cannot wait to see it finally finished. That
         fiasco is finally behind us. After ordering the dress over a year ago,
         I will finally have it in hand!
      </p>
      <h3 class="blogTitle">Wedding, Running, and Life</h3>
      <h5 class="date">February 16, 2017</h5>
      <p>I guess I've failed at my goal to blog 2X's per week. While I was right
        on track in January, February and the wedding has gotten the best of me.
        It has been a crazy last couple of weeks. The wedding is in less than 2 and
        a half weeks! I'm super excited about all that we have planned and can't
        wait for the day to finally arrive so we can celebrate and have one big
        party. We did the final walk through of the venue today and it is going
        to be amazing. <br> <br>
        As for running, I can tell I'm getting better. At the end of January, I
        decided to start going to the gym Parker has been attending for quite awhile.
        With 2 personal training sessions a week, I've noticed some significant
        improvements in my speed and economy. I think it has also been helpful to
        switch up my days and not run everyday. I highly recommend personal training
        for anyone looking to get out of a running rut. Not only is it fun, it is
        also helping me become a better runner. I cannot wait to see where it takes
        me over the next couple of months.
     </p>

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Goal Update</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 23, 2017</h5>
      <p>I cannot believe that January is over next week. It's crazy how quickly
        the weeks seem to fly by. It has definitely been a struggle for me to run.
        From busting my tailbone to an unusual knee pain, I've been very frustrated
        not being able to run when I want to run. However, I have successfully
        worked out 30 minutes every day. I have only had one day so far where I
        did not workout for at least 30 minutes. I have completed 110km to date,
        which leaves about 60km more to cover this month and stay on track to 2017.
        <br> <br>I have been very
        successful with my non-running goals. My knitting project this month was
        a baby hat. Sadly, the first hat was a little larger than I expected, so
        I have restarted with smaller needles and it is turning out well! I have
        also been developing with programming. Welcome to my new webpage!
        My new blog is up and running and was fully planned and designed by yours
        truly! I am excited to continue to grow and
        develop in my programming skills. As for the 2 blog posts per week, I haven't
        hit that goal, however, I have been successful in writting at least 1 per week,
        which is better than my previous blog writting. Overall, January has been
        a very successful month. I cannot wait to get back to running regularly once
         these aches and pains go away!
      </p>

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Getting Back into Running</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 22, 2017</h5>
      <p class="info">I've been working on getting back into running after the unfortuante ice
      fall a little over a week ago. Unfortuantely, it has been a little more challenging
      than I expected due to a knee that is also now hurting. I've resigned to run
      about once every other day. However, today the weather was lovely, so I made
      sure to try and get a long run in. It was amazing. I ran 8 miles, and felt
      good for most of it. Unfortuately, tonight, my knee is a little sore and I can
      feel my bruised tailbone. However, it was good to be back into it. This week
      I am super busy with wedding related items, so it might be a little struggle
      to find time to run each day. But I'll do my best to try and get at least
      thirty minutes of exercise each day.
      </p>

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Nuun Hydration Team</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 19, 2017</h5>
      <p>Exciting news! I just received my email from Nuun that I have been accepted
        to be a part of their ambassador team. I am super excited to be running
        for Nuun. My adventure with using Nuun began as I was training for Boston.
        I was struggling with significant fatigue during my training runs and due
        to my issues with heartburn, I couldn't each much before I went out for
        training runs. I spoke with a dietitian who recommended trying to use electrolytes
        and water during my runs to combat the fatigue. I tried quite a few different
        brands, however, due to the fizziness of most electrolyte solutions,
        I struggled to drink most brands without having significant heartburn. However,
        I tried Nuun and found if I let it sit overnight, I could drink it without
        issue. It has made a significant improvement in my fatigue levels. I cannot
        wait to share more about how I have seen Nuun help my running!
      </p>

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Black Ice: WHOOPS!</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 12, 2017</h5>
      <p class="info">Winter has arrived here in Ohio, and with it, my favorite
        season of running. I love bundling up to head outside for a long run. I
        also love the burning feeling you get in your lungs when you finish a
        solid hard effort in the cold. And, you can't beat running on fresh snow.
        However, the one aspect I do not like is the ice. Ice with a layer of fresh
        snow tends to be ok to run on, but sheer ice is not good. Tuesday morning,
        we woke up to freezing rain. As I'm not a fan of the treadmill, I told myself
        I would at least try and run. However, as soon as I was out of the apartment
        parking lot, I realized the sidewalks were super icy. I turned around and
        did a HIIT workout from the comfort of our living room. Yesterday, the
        rain had stopped and the weather was projected to warm up. As I started
        running, I noticed some spots were icy, however, it was not as bad as
        Tuesday morning. I made it 6 miles without difficulty. However, 2 streets
        from home, I had to stop while on ice for a turning car ​. Naturally shifting
        my momentum backwards caused me to fall backwards. Aside from an incredibly
        sore butt, I walked away with little issue. Unfortunately, 1 day post
        injury, I can barely walk and running is out of the question.  I'll be
        taking a hiatus from running to heal up my little behind. It was not the
        perfect texture for running yesterday.
