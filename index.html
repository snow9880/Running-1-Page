        <p>I grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado where I learned to love the
          outdoors and running. I started running in high school and walked on to the
          cross-country team at the University of Northern Colorado. After a few
          stress fractures, I gave up cross-country to join the Athletic Training
          program. Athletic Training has provided many opportunities to travel
          and explore the world around me. From Indiana to China to Guatemala to
          Ohio, the adventures continue. After moving to Ohio, I met my fiance,
          Parker. With the wedding coming, the adventures continue. My free time
          includes running, knitting, cooking, and learning to program. I love
          running marathons and half-marathons. Occasionally, I will run other
          distances. I have a secret love of Jelly Beans and almost anything
          sweet. On the weekend, you can find Parker and I in our favorite local
          coffee shop.

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Getting Back into Running</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 22, 2017</h5>
      <p class="info">I've been working on getting back into running after the unfortuante ice
      fall a little over a week ago. Unfortuantely, it has been a little more challenging
      than I expected due to a knee that is also now hurting. I've resigned to run
      about once every other day. However, today the weather was lovely, so I made
      sure to try and get a long run in. It was amazing. I ran 8 miles, and felt
      good for most of it. Unfortuately, tonight, my knee is a little sore and I can
      feel my bruised tailbone. However, it was good to be back into it. This week
      I am super busy with wedding related items, so it might be a little struggle
      to find time to run each day. But I'll do my best to try and get at least
      thirty minutes of exercise each day.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="blogTitle">Nuun Hydration Team</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 19, 2017</h5>
      <p>Exciting news! I just received my email from Nuun that I have been accepted
        to be a part of their ambassador team. I am super excited to be running
        for Nuun. My adventure with using Nuun began as I was training for Boston.
        I was struggling with significant fatigue during my training runs and due
        to my issues with heartburn, I couldn't each much before I went out for
        training runs. I spoke with a dietitian who recommended trying to use electrolytes
        and water during my runs to combat the fatigue. I tried quite a few different
        brands, however, due to the fizziness of most electrolyte solutions,
        I struggled to drink most brands without having significant heartburn. However,
        I tried Nuun and found if I let it sit overnight, I could drink it without
        issue. It has made a significant improvement in my fatigue levels. I cannot
        wait to share more about how I have seen Nuun help my running!

      <h3 class="blogTitle">Black Ice: WHOOPS!</h3>
      <h5 class="date">January 12, 2017</h5>
      <p class="info">Winter has arrived here in Ohio, and with it, my favorite
        season of running. I love bundling up to head outside for a long run. I
        also love the burning feeling you get in your lungs when you finish a
        solid hard effort in the cold. And, you can't beat running on fresh snow.
        However, the one aspect I do not like is the ice. Ice with a layer of fresh
        snow tends to be ok to run on, but sheer ice is not good. Tuesday morning,
        we woke up to freezing rain. As I'm not a fan of the treadmill, I told myself
        I would at least try and run. However, as soon as I was out of the apartment
        parking lot, I realized the sidewalks were super icy. I turned around and
        did a HIIT workout from the comfort of our living room. Yesterday, the
        rain had stopped and the weather was projected to warm up. As I started
        running, I noticed some spots were icy, however, it was not as bad as
        Tuesday morning. I made it 6 miles without difficulty. However, 2 streets
        from home, I had to stop while on ice for a turning car â€‹. Naturally shifting
        my momentum backwards caused me to fall backwards. Aside from an incredibly
        sore butt, I walked away with little issue. Unfortunately, 1 day post
        injury, I can barely walk and running is out of the question.  I'll be
        taking a hiatus from running to heal up my little behind. It was not the
        perfect texture for running yesterday.
